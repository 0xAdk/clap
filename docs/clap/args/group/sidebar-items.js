initSidebarItems({"struct":[["ArgGroup","ArgGroups are a family of related arguments and provide a few useful features for you. By placing arguments in a logical group, you can make easier requirement and exclusion rules. For  instance, you can make an ArgGroup required, this means that one (and *only* one) argument from that group must be present. Using more than one argument from an ArgGroup causes a  failure (graceful exit)."]]});
